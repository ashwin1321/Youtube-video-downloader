## Youtube-video-downloader

 I have created a simple program to download youtube video in highest resolution possible.
 Here we are asked to enter the video link. After entering the link it prints the video lenght and gets it highest resolution possible.
 We have to give the path where we wish to save the video. 

 res.download('place your path here')
