## Youtube-video-downloader

 I have created a simple program to download youtube video in highest resolution possible. <br>
 Here we are asked to enter the video link. After entering the link it prints the video lenght and gets it highest resolution possible. <br>
 We have to give the path where we wish to save the video. <br>
<br>
 res.download('place your path here')
